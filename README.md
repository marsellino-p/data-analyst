The company's revenue figures increased from January to April, where April saw the most sales during this period. This happened because, in April, sales were evenly distributed on all seat models, in addition, there were quite high sales on models with high selling prices, namely Cosmo, Energy, and Volt. This chair model certainly contributed a large income in April. The order of the selling price of the chair models from the highest to the lowest is:
1. Cosmo - $375
2. Energy - $350
3. Volts - $295
4. Urban - $260
5. Flash - $235
6. Aero - $220
